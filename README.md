## Hypothesis
The project focuses on building an algorithmic trading system to predict the future trends of Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock prices using the Prophet library. Time series predictions are valuable for understanding potential market movements and making informed investment decisions. By analyzing historical AAPL stock price data, we aim to generate forecasts for the next 36 months, providing valuable insights into possible future price movements. 

Additionally, we will utilize the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for text analysis to extract meaningful information from news articles. Combining both time series forecasting and text analysis will enable us to gain valuable insights into AAPL stock price trends and market sentiment from news articles, enhancing our ability to make data-driven investment decisions. <br>
